# 🔢 NumPy

**NumPy** is the fundamental package for scientific computing with Python. It contains among other things:

- A powerful N-dimensional array object.
- Sophisticated broadcasting functions.
- Tools for integrating C/C++ and Fortran code.
- Useful linear algebra, Fourier transform, and random number capabilities.

## 📦 Installation

Install NumPy using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy
```

Or with conda:

```bash
conda install numpy
```

## 🚀 Getting Started

Example usage:

```python
import numpy as np

# Create an array
arr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])

# Basic operations
print(arr + 5)
print(np.mean(arr))
```

## 🔧 Features

- Efficient multi-dimensional container of generic data.
